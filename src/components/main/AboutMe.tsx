        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am a passionate San Diego based software engineer who has worn many
        hats after nearly a decade as a professional programmer. I have filled
        roles such as Front End Web Developer, Back End Web Developer, React
        Native Cross-Platform Mobile Developer, Android Developer, Micro
        Embedded Developer, and Cloud Architect. In my free time I can be found
        coding personal projects, reverse engineering software, producing
        electronic music, skateboarding, and attending live music events.
